How well is the timing specification met with your original program?

Using millis(), I recorded that each run through loop() takes 1.003 seconds, or 3 milliseconds too long.


What happens when you double filterSize?

After doubling filterSize, each loop() takes between 1.003 and 1.004 seconds.

What is the file name of your graph image?

"oldTiming.numbers" is the plot for the old timinig method
"betterTiming.numbers' is the plot using better timing
"Plot.java" contains the code for the program that also plots the better timing method
