Explain your understanding of the code that transforms A/D counts
into engineering units:

The temperature probe on the Arduino reads analog voltages, and then it assigns and returns certain "A/D counts" to specific voltages.
In order to transform counts to temperatures, we can perform dimensional analysis, which is what the code is:

(x Counts)(1.1 Volts/1023 Counts)(100 °C/Volt) - 50°C

The "-50" at the end is the reference temperature; in other words, the probe will read 0V at -50 °C.

How many values did you average to get a reasonably stable temperature?

I averaged 10 readings to get a stable temperature.

Did you compute the average in A/D counts and then convert to temperature,
or did you convert first and compute the average using temperature values?

I computed the average in A/D counts first.

What is the file name of your graph image?

Transferred into the class after a week, which is why the assignment is late.
